Hack For the World is a 12-hour hackathon for high-schoolers. Students from across the Chicagoland area will come for the weekend, teaming up (or going solo) to build an app, game, or website. We’ll provide free meals & drinks. In the evening, judges will pick the best projects to demo for everyone and win prizes. There'll be raffles and giveaways throughout the event as well! You’ll meet people, create amazing new things, & most importantly, have fun.

	<center><h id="faq">FAQ</h></center>
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="item1"> <strong>How much does it cost?</strong><br>Nothing! Registration and attendance are 100% free, with meals, drinks, swag, & workshops included.</div>
  <div class="item2"><p id="item2text"><strong>Who can participate?</strong><br>Any current student grades 9–12. If you’re under that age, send an email to us <a href="contact.html">here.</a></p></div>
  <div class="item3"><p id="item3text"><strong>Hacking!? Is that safe?</strong><br>Hold up! No, we’re not “hacking” servers or databases. The word is being constructively re-defined as building things—apps, games, websites, etc. At HackFTW, it’s all safe, supervised, & entirely educational.</p></div>  
  <div class="item4"><p id="item4text"><strong>What if I’m new to coding?</strong><br> At HackFTW, complete beginners are not only welcome, but expected! Learn as you go with our intro workshops & mentors.</p></div>
  <div class="item5"><strong> What can I make?</strong><br> This years theme is based on the UN global goals. Students will pick a goal and build their project around that specific goal. We want to encourage students to make a difference in the world. The UN global goals are a set of 17 goals established by world leaders for a better world by 2030. These goals have the power to end poverty, fight inequality and stop climate change. Guided by the goals, it is now up to all of us: governments, businesses, civil society and the general public to work together to build a better future for everyone.</div>
	<div class="item6"><strong> What if I can already code?</strong><br>HackFTW is for you, too! We welcome (and have prizes for) absolute beginners, experts, & everyone in between.</div>
  <div class="item7"><p id="item7text"><strong>Do I need a team?</strong><br>Nope! You’ll have an opportunity to meet fellow hackers and make teams of up to 5; find some new friends, bring yours, or work alone.</p></div>
  <div class="item8"><p id="item8text"><strong> What should I bring?</strong><br>Plan to bring a student ID, computer (any kind), chargers, and anything else for your hack (e.g. hardware).</p></div>
  <div class="item9"><strong> Who runs this? Is it supervised?</strong><br>We’re independently-organized by high schoolers, sponsored via an international nonprofit called Hack Club. It’s fully supervised by adult mentors & chaperones.</div>

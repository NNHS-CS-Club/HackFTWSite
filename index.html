      <h1>Hack For The World 2023</h1>
      <div class="event-info">
        <h2>Hack For the World is a 12-hour hackathon for high-schoolers. Students from across the Chicagoland area will come for the weekend, teaming up (or going solo) to build an app, game, or website. We’ll provide free meals & drinks. In the evening, judges will pick the best projects to demo for everyone and win prizes. There'll be raffles and giveaways throughout the event as well! You’ll meet people, create amazing new things, & most importantly, have fun.</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Hacking!? Is that safe?        </h3>
        <p>Hold up! No, we’re not “hacking” servers or databases. The word is being constructively re-defined as building things—apps, games, websites, etc. At HackFTW, it’s all safe, supervised, & entirely educational.        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What if I’m new to coding?
        </h3>
        <p>At HackFTW, complete beginners are not only welcome, but expected! Learn as you go with our intro workshops & mentors.

        <h3>What if I can already code?

        <p>HackFTW is for you, too! We welcome (and have prizes for) absolute beginners, experts, & everyone in between.
        </p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I need a team?
        </h3>
        <p>Nope! You’ll have an opportunity to meet fellow hackers and make teams of up to 4; find some new friends, bring yours, or work alone.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What should I bring?
        </h3>
        <p>Plan to bring a student ID, computer (any kind), chargers, and anything else for your hack (e.g. hardware).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Who runs this? Is it supervised?
        </h3>
        <p>We’re independently-organized by high schoolers in the Naperville area, mainly Naperville North Computer Science Club members. It’s fully supervised by adult mentors & chaperones.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What can I make?
        </h3>
        <p>Due to rapid tropical deforestation, this year's theme is based on rainforests/improving the general tropical environment. Think outside of the box! We encourage students to channel their creativity into their projects. Create a talking AI that promotes meatless burgers or develop a game where players race to replant trees. The sky’s the limit!
